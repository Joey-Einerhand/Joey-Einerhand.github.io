<p>
  The VR tutorial was a thesis project to teach people with a lack of technical backgrounds how to use Virtual Reality.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the things I did:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Desiging and implementing an XR-framework for the client, based on the cutting edge Unity XR Interaction Toolkit 2.0</li>
  <li>Desiging and implementing the VR Tutorial level in the Unity Engine </li>
  <li>Researched the level of intuitiveness in similar games and how to create an intuitive tutorial </li>
  <li>Executed playtests to test the intuitiveness of the tutorial with the target audience </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For the complete picture, see the "Thesis" button at the top of this page.
