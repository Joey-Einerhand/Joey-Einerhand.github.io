<p>In Blow Up The Sun, the player has to colonize the planets in their solar system to harvest resources, so they can research more technologies and eventually Blow Up The Sun.</p>

<p>Blow Up The Sun is a game made in 48 hours <a src="https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2024">Kenney Jam 24</a>, developed by 1 person.
The Jam limited participants to only use asset packs created by Kenney, the gamejam host.</p>
<p>I developed BUTS as a proof-of-concept for a potential full game.</p>
