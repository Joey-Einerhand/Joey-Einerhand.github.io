<p>
  Hide 'n Tilt Labyrinth is a one-on-one player versus player hide and seek game with a twist. The "hider" hides themself by tilting the board to try and get the ball into a hole. The "seeker" then tries to find the hole the "hider" hid in, in first person.
  The multiplayer side of Hide 'n Tilt labyrinth is implemented via a domoticz web server.
